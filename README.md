# PID_2D_controller

Read the documentation pdf for complete explanation of the solution
I made this project as a part of entrance test of
Aerial Robotics Lab, IIT Kharagpur. It is a MATLAB
based simulated model of a 2D PID Controller.


Your first task is to make a PID controller for a Multirotor restricted to move in YZ plane. The Multirotor will
have motion along the z axis and along the y axis, whereas no motion along the x axis, which is coming out of
the computer screen. Z is directed upwards and Y is directed in right direction on the monitor.
Make sure the PID coefficients are tuned properly. Your controller must be able to follow any specified trajectory
